Although taste is a subjective matter, wine drinkers generally agree that wine may be ranked by quality. As such, it is possible to model wine preferences by using machine learning algorithms. My research compared different models and used the wine's physicochemical properties to try and predict the best models for that task. My research found that based on the given criterias given by the dataset, the Extra Trees Classifier is the preferred model  as it outperforms all the other models in accuracy, AUC, Recall, Precesion, F1, Kappa, and MCC
